# California Housing Prices Prediction

## Overview
This project builds a Linear Regression model to predict median house prices in California districts using data from the 1990 census. It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
Source: [California Housing Prices on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

## How to Run
1. Download `housing.csv` from the Kaggle link and place it in the folder.
3. Open `Predictive_Model_for_California_Housing_Prices.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run all cells.

## Key Results
- RMSE: ~$69,000 (average prediction error)
- RÂ² Score: ~0.65 (65% variance explained)
